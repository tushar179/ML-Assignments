## Assignment Tasks

### **1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**  
**Learning Outcome:** CO2 L1

Perform the following operations using R/Python on suitable datasets:

- Read data from different formats (CSV, XLS).
- Find shape of the dataset.
- Detect missing values.
- Identify data type of each column.
- Find zeros in the dataset.
- Indexing, selecting, and sorting data.
- Describe attributes and data types.
- Count unique values, inspect data formats, and convert data types.

---

### **2. Summary Statistics and Data Preparation**  
**Learning Outcome:** CO2 L1

- Compute and display summary statistics (min, max, mean, range, std dev, variance, percentiles).
- Visualize feature distributions using histograms.
- Perform data cleaning, integration, and transformation.
- Build a simple data model (e.g., Classification).

---

### **3. Data Visualization**  
**Learning Outcome:** CO3 L2

Visualize the data using the results from Assignments 1 and 2:

- Scatter plot
- Bar plot
- Box plot
- Pie chart
- Line chart

Use appropriate libraries in R/Python (like matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2).

### **4. Customer Response Prediction (Classification)**  
**Learning Outcome:** CO4 L2

Apply a suitable ML classification algorithm on a cosmetics shop dataset to predict customer response for a special offer. Evaluate model performance using:

- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

---

### **5. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**  
**Learning Outcome:** CO6 L2  
**Dataset:** [Mall Customers - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers)

- Apply data preprocessing.
- Perform train-test split.
- Apply at least **two clustering algorithms** based on spending score.
- Identify profitable customer segments.

---

### **6. Temperature Prediction (Regression)**  
**Learning Outcome:** CO5 L2  
**Dataset:** [India Temperatures - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperaturesof-india?select=temperatures.csv)

- Apply **Linear Regression** to predict month-wise temperature.
- Evaluate model using MSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
- Visualize regression model performance.

---

### **7. Admission Prediction (Classification using Decision Tree)**  
**Learning Outcome:** CO4 L2  
**Dataset:** [Graduate Admissions - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)

- Perform data preprocessing (Label Encoding, Transformation).
- Apply train-test split.
- Use Decision Tree classifier to predict admission chances.
- Evaluate model performance.
